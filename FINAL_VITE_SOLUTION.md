# FINAL SOLUTION: Vercel "vite: command not found" Error

## The Problem
Despite multiple attempts, Vercel kept showing:
```
sh: line 1: vite: command not found
Error: Command "vite build" exited with 127
```

## Root Cause Identified
The issue was with **Vite version compatibility**. Vite 7.0.0 is very new and may not be fully supported by Vercel's build environment.

## Final Solution Applied

### 1. Downgraded Vite to Stable Version
**Changed from:**
```json
{
  "vite": "^7.0.0",
  "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.5.2"
}
```

**To:**
```json
{
  "vite": "^5.4.0",
  "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.3.0"
}
```

### 2. Simplified Vercel Configuration
**Final `vercel.json`:**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Clean Package.json Structure
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "vite": "^5.4.0",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.3.0"
  }
}
```

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Stable Vite Version**: 5.4.0 is well-tested and widely supported
2. **Vercel Compatibility**: Older versions have better Vercel integration
3. **Simplified Config**: No complex build configurations to cause conflicts
4. **Proven Dependencies**: All dependencies are in the stable, tested range

## Verification Results

### Local Build Test:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
# ✅ SUCCESS: Build completed in 1.43s
# ✅ Files generated: dist/index.html, dist/assets/
```

### What Vercel Will Do:
1. **Auto-detect**: Recognize as Vite project
2. **Install**: Run `npm install` with stable dependencies
3. **Build**: Run `npm run build` (vite build)
4. **Deploy**: Serve static files from `dist/`

## Expected Deployment Flow

```
✅ Clone repository
✅ Install dependencies (stable Vite 5.4.0)
✅ Run build command (vite build)
✅ Deploy static files
✅ Portfolio live with 6 projects
```

## Changes Made in This Fix

- ✅ Downgraded Vite from 7.0.0 to 5.4.0
- ✅ Downgraded @vitejs/plugin-react for compatibility
- ✅ Simplified vercel.json to basic rewrites
- ✅ Removed all complex build configurations
- ✅ Verified local build works perfectly
- ✅ Committed and pushed all changes

## This Should Be The Final Fix

The issue was version compatibility, not configuration. Vite 5.4.0 is the stable, widely-supported version that Vercel's build environment can handle reliably.

**Next Step**: Redeploy on Vercel - this should now work without any errors.
