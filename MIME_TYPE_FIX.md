# MIME Type Error Fix - Deployment Summary

## Issue Fixed
The "Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of 'text/html'" error was caused by incorrect Vercel configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated vercel.json
- **Before**: Used complex `builds` and `routes` configuration
- **After**: Simplified to use `buildCommand`, `outputDirectory`, and `rewrites`
- **Why**: The new format is cleaner and more reliable for static React apps

### 2. Enhanced vite.config.js
- Added explicit build configuration
- Set `outDir` to 'dist'
- Set `assetsDir` to 'assets'
- Added `base: '/'` for correct path resolution

### 3. Added .vercelignore
- Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
- Includes backend, env files, and documentation

### 4. Updated index.html
- Better meta tags for SEO
- Updated title to be more descriptive

## Verification
- ✅ Build process works locally (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Dist folder contains correct files
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed to GitHub

## Next Steps
1. Redeploy frontend on Vercel
2. Test the deployment URL
3. Verify all routes work correctly
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors

## Expected Result
The MIME type error should be resolved, and the React app should load correctly on Vercel with proper module imports.
