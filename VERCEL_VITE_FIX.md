# Vercel Deployment Fix - "vite: command not found" Error

## Problem
During Vercel deployment, you encountered:
```
sh: line 1: vite: command not found
Error: Command "vite build" exited with 127
```

## Root Cause
The issue was that `vite` was listed in `devDependencies` but Vercel's build process couldn't find it during deployment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Moved Critical Dependencies
**Before:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": { ... },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^7.0.0",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.5.2",
    ...
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "vite": "^7.0.0",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.5.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": { ... }
}
```

### 2. Simplified Vercel Configuration
**Updated `vercel.json`:**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Updated `.vercelignore`
```
node_modules
.env
.env.local
*.log
.DS_Store
backend/
*.md
.git
```

## Why This Works

1. **Dependencies vs DevDependencies**: 
   - `dependencies` are installed in production
   - `devDependencies` are often skipped in production builds
   - Vercel needs `vite` and `@vitejs/plugin-react` for the build process

2. **Simplified Configuration**:
   - Let Vercel auto-detect the Vite framework
   - Use simple rewrites for SPA routing
   - Remove complex build configurations that can cause conflicts

3. **Clean Build Process**:
   - Vercel will automatically run `npm install`
   - Then run `npm run build` (which uses `vite build`)
   - Serve the `dist` directory as static files

## Verification

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Should see output:
# dist/index.html - 0.54 kB
# dist/assets/index.*.css - 39.50 kB
# dist/assets/index.*.js - 488.31 kB
```

### Vercel Deployment:
1. **Push to GitHub**: All changes committed
2. **Vercel Build**: Will now find `vite` command
3. **Success**: Build should complete without errors

## Next Steps

1. **Redeploy on Vercel**: Trigger a new deployment
2. **Monitor Build Logs**: Check for successful build completion
3. **Test Live Site**: Verify all features work correctly

## Additional Notes

- The `vite` package is now in `dependencies` ensuring it's available during deployment
- The simplified `vercel.json` reduces potential configuration conflicts
- All documentation files are ignored to keep deployment clean
- The build process is now more reliable and predictable

## Expected Result
âœ… Vercel deployment should complete successfully without the "vite: command not found" error.
